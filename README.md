# Assignment 4: React Calculator App

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to apply your knowledge of React by building a fully functional calculator app. You will start with a provided boilerplate code and implement the necessary features as specified. 

## Features and Requirements

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the boilerplate code from the GitHub Classroom assignment link provided:
     ```bash
     git clone <your-repo-link>
     cd <repo-directory>
     ```
   - **Install Dependencies:** After cloning, run the following command to install the necessary node modules and then start the app:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm start

     ```

2. **Design Requirements:**
   - **Figma Design:** You must follow the design specifications provided in the Figma file. Ensure that the UI of your calculator matches the design exactly. [Design file ->](https://www.figma.com/design/rT7hlMM2kJHfQtaZ4C5vf4/Calculator-App?node-id=74-244&t=D2Agfm2eMPFH9evE-1)

3. **Functional Requirements:**
   - **Calculator Features:**
     - **Number Input:** Users should be able to input numbers using the calculator buttons.
     - **Basic Operations:** Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
     - **Chained Calculations:** The calculator should support chained operations (e.g., `2 + 3 * 4 - 5`).
     - **Equals (=) Button:** The result should be calculated and displayed when the equals button is pressed.
     - **Clear Functionality:** Implement a clear button to reset the calculator.
   - **No Tutorial:** There will be no step-by-step tutorial provided for this assignment. You are encouraged to consult online resources and tutorials to understand how to implement the required features.

## Implementation Instructions

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create the basic HTML structure for the calculator app, including buttons for numbers, operations, equals, and clear.

2. **CSS and Bootstrap:**
   - Use the provided Figma design to style your app. Ensure that your app is responsive and follows the design precisely.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Implement the necessary React components to handle input, calculations, and display of the result.
   - Ensure that chained calculations are processed correctly and that the calculator updates dynamically as users interact with it.
   - **Ensure the Following React Concepts Are Used:**
     - **Hooks:** Utilize `useState` for managing the state of the calculator's display and current input.
     - **Components:** Break down the calculator into functional components (e.g., Display, ButtonPanel, Button) for better organization and reusability.
     - **Props:** Use props to pass data such as button values between components, ensuring proper communication, functionality and display.


## Submission

- **Commit and Push:** Once you've completed the assignment, commit your changes and push them to the original repository.
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "<your commit message>"
  git push origin main
